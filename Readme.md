This project use the LIWC dictionary for sentiment analysis on transcripts of speeches given by Obama and Romney.  Currently the only analysis done is a comparison of the category strengths present on a corpus of their speeches (details here: http://www.liwc.net/descriptiontable1.php).  The speeches are dated so the individual speeches may be plotted over time as well.
